# imap version 1.0  by Ian Frechette.
# To give credit where credit is due, this was inspired by Run's
# ircmap2 script.  I looked at it once and decided it was slow and kludgy to
# deal with and wrote my own.  All code here is original to me.
#
# Currently the only commands  are
# /initmap [stuff]        - which will create a the data by issuing a /links 
#                         from the current server.
#                         - stuff can be whatever.. The map is split up if you
#                         you try to use stuff.. try   '*.ca *'
# /gomap [server_name]    - will show the current map of the visible irc
#                         network.  If a servername is given it'll try to
#                         recurse outward from that server instead of the
#                         current server.
# Note: you may issue the /gomap command as many times as you want after
# the data has been created.  You may also /initmap at any time to update the
# data.
#
# Note Also.. as of yet hostmasks are not possible, nor would they really
# make much sense.
#
# This script has been modified to work correctly on the EPIC client.

# called with  makemap level server
# this is the real workhorse.. It's a recursive function.. It starts at
# recursion level 1 and follows the servers through the data.
# The following example doesn't use real argument types.
# e.g.   makemap 1 colorado  looks at colorado's list of links
#                            displays each one and then recurses into that
#                            link if it can.  So when it gets to uiuc 
#                            makemap is  called.   makemap 2 uiuc
#                            and it follows it's links etc etc..
# loops in the data are avoided by removing each link from the list entirely
# as it's used.  map.restore can be called later to restore data
