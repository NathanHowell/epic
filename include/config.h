 *  -- You cant just add a ``#define DEFAULT_X'' and expect it to work.
 *     Those things that do not have defaults are that way on purpose.
 *     Either they have their own defaults, or a default is inappropriate.

/* 
 *  This is where you define a list of ``fallback'' servers in case the client
 *  cannot under other circumstances figure out where to connect.   Normally,
 *  the server to use is determined by the ``SERVERS_FILE'' (see below), or
 *  by a server specified on the command line.   But if for some reason your
 *  ``SERVERS_FILE'' isnt there or isnt readable, or the user doesnt specify
 *  a server, then this list will be used.
 *
 *  The list should be a space seperated list of the form 
 *  hostname:portnum:password.  The portnum and password are optional.  
 *  An example is:
 *
 *	#define DEFAULT_SERVER "irc.iastate.edu irc-2.mit.edu:6666:lag-2sux"
 *
 *  THIS DEFINE IS -!-NOT-!- OPTIONAL.  You must provide a fallback list or
 *  the client will NOT compile and work properly!  Use the default here if
 *  you dont have other servers to use.

 * This version of epic allows a script (or the user) to set a time interval
 * between NOTIFY checks to something other than the historical value of
 * 60 seconds.  However, very low values may have a strongly negative effect
 * on CPU usage or on lag time to the server, and so you, the person compiling
 * this client, may not want /SET NOTIFY_INTERVAL to be set lower than a 
 * value you consider to be appropriate.  The default is 60 because that
 * is the historical value.  You may change this to be higher or lower, as

 * The left and right brace characters ('{', '}') are special characters in

 * are not expected to be treated any differently than any other alphanumeric
 * character.  When this is #define'd, the client makes a best guess attempt
 * to determine if a { is being used as a brace, or as an alphanumeric char.
 *
 * The way it determines is simple:
 *	An lbrace ('{') is a normal character UNLESS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
 *		* It is the first character on a line
 *		* It is preceeded by whitespace
 *		* It is preceeded by a right paren (')')
 *		* It is preceeded by a right brace ('}')
 * Similarly,
 *	An rbrace ('}') is a normal character UNLESS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
 *		* It is the last character on a line
 *		* It is followed by whitespace
 *		* It is followed by a left paren ('(')
 *		* It is followed by a left brace ('{')
 *
 * If the following is #define'd, the above rules are in effect.  If the
 * following is #undef'd, then the normal, traditional rules apply and every
 * { and } is counted for bracing purposes.
 *
 * Some day, if this works out, this will become the default behavior -- 
 * but not today.
