EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* Should /set beep off suppress stripping of beeps?
* Allegedly 464 numeric shouldn't force a reconnect if we're registered.
* The mangler might expand things more than 3 times -- possible
  interference from the attribute parser?  caused by many ^v's.
* Add /timer -delete_for_window or something to avoid window switch warnings?
* After calling connectory(), try to output meaningful error messages, not 
  just blindly calling my_strerror(errno).
* scrollback/scrollforward/scrollend should be controlled by /window verbs
  and not solely by keybindings.
* /TYPE honors keybindings, and calls edit_char(), but /XTYPE -L does not 
  honor key bindings because it calls input_add_character().
* /DEFER needs to be server-specific.
* The check for "sun_len" in <sys/un.h> is bogus and unnecessary since we
  can just use #ifdef HAVE_SA_LEN for that.
* Input cursor wigs out if 2ndary window is < 32 columns wide...
* ^C,,, eats up all commas, not just the first one.
* Join #foo, then join #foobar, doesn't WHO for #foobar (maxxx)
* Built in functions need to call 'parse_server_index'!
* Study update_input() and update_all_windows() and determine if used properly
* Change AC_ARG_WITH(ipv6, to AC_ARG_USING(ipv6,
<larne> AC_ARG_ENABLE(protocols, 
<larne> [  --enable-protocols=protocol[[,protocol...]] Select which protocols
+to support [[default: all]].], 
<larne> [ protocols=$enableval ], 
<larne> [ protocols=$defaultprots ]) 
* DCC send yourself a file and then DCC get it leads to wackiness
* New function, you give it a window level, it gives you the window refnum
* IPV6-over-dcc, i promised morty i would.
* ON WHO hook not thrown in correct window.
* Shall remove_trailing_spaces honor a \ before a space trailing?
* get_window() should use get_window_by_desc() and not its own thing
* Larne's "missing line" bug.
* The "Select() failed" bug
* $glob() and $globi() tend to choke on wierdly named filenames, or rather, on
  wierd masks.
* $isnumber() will cause internal damage to the client when fed numbers that
  are too large for some unknown reason.

* This involved substantial rewrites of parse.c, and numbers.c

* /on window_kill provides two args now, $0 is refnum, $1 is name/refnum.
* Rename "numeric_banner" to "banner"
* Rename "parse_notice" to "p_notice"
* In /xecho, rename 'banner' local var to 'want_banner'.
* Revamp p_notice to look like and act like p_privmsg as much as possible.
* Finish the rest of the larnifications.  Done with phase 1.  Huzzah!
* Fixes for NAMES processing, found by paladin (ce)
* Fixes for configure to do deeper searching for perl (ce)
* Fix /on 311, /on 312. /on 317, /on 353, and /on names.
* Split NOTIFY stuff off into its own timer
* Add #define MINIMUM_NOTIFY_INTERVAL in config.h
* Add set_notify_interval, force that /SET NOTIFY_INTERVAL >= MIN_NOT_INT
* Fix default /on 321 output so it doesn't call display_msg.  BAH!
* Add $logctl(REFNUMS [ACTIVE|INACTIVE|ALL]), return all log refnums, for wd.
* Add an "activity timer" to logfiles to indicate last time written to.
* Add /LOG <refnum> ACTIVITY which updates activity timer w/o writing to log.
* Add $logctl([GET|SET] <refnum> ACTIVITY) to get or set the activity timer. 
* Add new script, "suppressmotd" to implemenet /set suppress_server_motd
* Don't hook /on names twice in the normal case. (rb void)
* Revamp $timerctl() to handle its args like $serverctl() does now.
* Add a bunch of new functions in 'functions' script.  See UPDATES.
* Tentative change to $glob*() making them "dequote" the glob before looking
  for it.  This probably isn't a real answer.  I get the feeling that a new
  pair of functions that make just one search as keerf suggested is probably
  the answer.
* Set (and destroy) server->funny_match.  Fixes crash using /LIST.
* Fix numeric handlers for 313, 317.
* Docs say that $info(o) includes 'g' if $glob() is available.  Add it.
* Revamp $win(serv|size|chan|bound|level)() to use get_window_by_desc.
* Revamp $win(screen)() to use get_window_by_desc.
* Use get_window_by_refnum(0) and not 'current_window'
* Allow a \ to escape a space where spaces would be stripped.
* Above bug fixes things like switch ($foo) {(foo\  ) {...}} to work.
* Add handler for /on 330, "user is logged in" numeric in ircu.
* Don't honor/ignore "#" in a window name/refnum.  This was lame anways.
* Fix is_window_visible/get_window to use get_window_by_desc().
* More conversions in functions.c to handle strings-to-winrefs.
* Add back support for $mychannels(#winref)
* Fix null deref with /LOG KILL
* Ignore KICKS based on the victim as well as the kicker.
* Don't clobber 'target' in /on general_notice; pass the original target.
* Altered the way the "word philosophy" is interpreted by new_next_args() and
  word_count().  This basically equates to two things..  Quoted words must be
  seperated by spaces, and the final quote must be present.  Stuff started
  breaking when I added the second one, so I #if'd it out.
* Fixed a leak with "/alias (args) {}".
* Flood checking seems to have failed somehow in the last few weeks.  Tracked
  it down to an inverted FLOOD hook and the fact that a matching flood now
  causes the message to be ignored, which never used to happen.  Fixed the
  last one by adding /set FLOOD_IGNORE on/off.
* Found a good answer to $glob*()..  Giving them a null argument will now
  cause them to read the rest of the arg list as a single argument.
  eg, $glob(""  my "lovely" filename with spaces and quotes.jpg )
  (note the spaces at the beginning and end which are part of the filename)
* Turned a few extra options on in the $glob*() glob() call.  Now glob
  characters can be escaped by preceeding them with slashes, and brace chars
  can be used in this fashion:  file{1,2,33} matches file1, file2 and file33.
* Cleaned tabkey.ce up to deal with violently evil filenames more gracefully
  and the changes to the word philosophy and $glob().
* Added $open(), $read(), $write(), $close() regression tests.
* Tuned the autoget script to deal with url quoted dcc requests gracefully.
* Got rid of the reference to word_count() in /fe and /fec.
* Diked safe_new_next_arg() out and made it use new_next_arg() instead.
* Fixed a problem that broke ctcp-over-dcc, reported by NSX.
* Fixed a problem that broke unix socket detection, reported by Q_ (unconfirmed).
* Changed the default FLOOD_IGNORE setting to off.
* Fixed a bug in the commandqueues script.
* Altered 324 processing so that the hook is called when joining a channel.
* tabkey.ce alteratered to make input line modification smoother.

* Fix for a serious problem in the language parser that causes script logic
  to fail, perhaps requiring a restart.  This is *REMOTELY TRIGGERABLE*.
  This bug appeared in the 1.1.* tree and isn't present in 1.0.1 which is the
  latest release.  If you are running 1.1.* (commit id 470 or below), people
  may be able to knock you off the irc server with specially crafted
  messages.  I might release the details later to give people time to upgrade.
